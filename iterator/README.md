# Iterator

Iterator provides a rich interface for iteration, based on the JavaScript
iterator protocol.

The iterator package provides implementations for iterating
arrays and objects, as well as anything that implements `iterate` or upgrades
iterators that merely implement `next`.

```
npm install @collections/iterator
```

## Collections
